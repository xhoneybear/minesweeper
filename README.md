# Minesweeper
A classic minesweeper game! Written in Python, utilizing TkInter GUI library.

The goal of the project was for me to get more comfortable with Python coding, serving me as a milestone of my coding journey.
It was also meant to be as close in terms of design and functionality to the Minesweeper known from MS Windows XP!

## What is implemented:
- [x] Base game functionality
- [x] No bomb on first move
- [x] "?" marks
- [ ] Config file
- [ ] Optimized code + comments

You can start playing by cloning the repository or simply downloading *minesweeper_gui.py* as it is capable of downloading required data files.
Make sure you have Python and TkInter installed.
The first run will ask you to install fonts required for the game to properly function (and for now any subsequent runs until you install the fonts). You can deny the installation, but the experience might be lacking.

Happy minesweeping! ðŸ’£
